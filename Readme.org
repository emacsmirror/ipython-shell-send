* ipython-shell-send

This is a small emacs package to send code regions to the IPython interpreter.
It provides functionality similar to the built-in ~python-shell-send-*~
commands, but with two differences:
1. IPython magic commands such as ~!ls~ or ~%timeit~ work
2. The result of the final expression is printed, as in Jupyter cell execution

The following functions send the buffer, highlighted region, or current defun to a running IPython interpreter:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ipython-shell-send-buffer
  ipython-shell-send-region
  ipython-shell-send-defun
#+END_SRC

To use these functions, you should configure ~run-python~ to launch an IPython console, instead of a regular Python console.
