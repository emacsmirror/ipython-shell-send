* ipython-shell-send
  
This is a small emacs package to send code regions to the IPython interpreter.
It provides functionality similar to the built-in ~python-shell-send-*~ functions.
The main difference is that ~ipython-shell-send-*~ can send IPython magic,
whereas ~python-shell-send-*~ cannot (unless the code region consists of a single line).

=ipython-shell-send= provides the following functions which can send the buffer,
highlighted region, or current defun to the IPython interpreter:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ipython-shell-send-buffer
  ipython-shell-send-region
  ipython-shell-send-defun
#+END_SRC

** Details 

The code for ~ipython-shell-send-*~ is almost exactly the same as ~python-shell-send-*~,
which works by sending code to a tmpfile executed by the ~exec()~ function in Python.
The only difference is that ~ipython-shell-send-*~ uses the IPython magic ~%run -i~ to execute the
tmpfile.
