* ipython-shell-send
  
This is a small emacs package to send code regions to the IPython interpreter.
It provides functionality similar to the built-in ~python-shell-send-*~
functions from ~python.el~. The main difference is that ~ipython-shell-send~ can send regions
containing IPython magic (such as ~!ls~ or ~%timeit~), whereas ~python.el~
in general cannot (aside from the special case noted in Details/Note).

=ipython-shell-send= provides the following functions which can send the buffer,
highlighted region, or current defun to the IPython interpreter:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ipython-shell-send-buffer
  ipython-shell-send-region
  ipython-shell-send-defun
#+END_SRC

** Details 

The code for ~ipython-shell-send-*~ is almost exactly the same as ~python-shell-send-*~,
which works by sending code to a tmpfile executed by the Python function ~exec()~.
The only difference is that ~ipython-shell-send-*~ uses the IPython magic ~%run -i~ to execute the
tmpfile instead.

*** Note

Note that the built-in ~python.el~ is able to send IPython magic in one special case, when the region consists
of only 1 line. This precludes using IPython magics in for loops or functions, and can also be inconvenient when
needing to send multiple lines of IPython magic to the console. Thus my motivation for writing this package.
